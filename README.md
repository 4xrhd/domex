**domex** is a powerful and intuitive tool designed to streamline the extraction of domains from HackerOne JSON files. Whether youâ€™re sifting through security reports or managing threat intelligence, this tool simplifies the process of extracting and cleaning domain names with ease.

## Features

- **Effortless Domain Extraction**: Automatically parse JSON files and extract domain names from specified fields.
- **Regex Cleaning**: Remove unnecessary regex characters and wildcards to get clean, usable domain names.
- **Simple Setup**: Easy-to-use Bash script with straightforward commands for quick integration into your workflow.

## Requirements

- **jq**: A command-line JSON processor. Make sure you have `jq` installed on your system. You can install it using your package manager:

    brew install jq
    ```

## How It Works

1. **Input**: Provide a JSON file containing domain information.
2. **Extraction**: Use the script to extract domain names from the JSON structure.
3. **Cleaning**: The tool processes the domains to remove regex symbols and wildcards.
4. **Output**: Get a clean list of domains ready for your analysis.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/4xrhd/domex.git

2. **Make the Script Executable**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x domex.sh
   ```

3. **Run the Script**:

  "targets": [
    { "host": "^www3\\.olf\\.com$" },
    { "host": "^xtractasia\\.com$" }
  ]
}
